** DONE Escaping of special characters
   CLOSED: [2010-11-12 Fri 11:42]
Lucene supports escaping special characters that are part of the query
syntax. The current list special characters are

: + - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \

To escape these character use the \ before the character. For example
to search for (1+1):2 use the query:

: \(1\+1\)\:2

** TODO Support '!' as a synonym for NOT
** TODO Proximity search
** TODO Term boosting
** TODO Fuzzy searches
** TODO Put code into a QP module
This may be a bit tricky b/c treetop is finding the extension modules
by name.

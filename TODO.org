** DONE Escaping of special characters
   CLOSED: [2010-11-12 Fri 11:42]
Lucene supports escaping special characters that are part of the query
syntax. The current list special characters are

: + - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \

To escape these character use the \ before the character. For example
to search for (1+1):2 use the query:

: \(1\+1\)\:2

** DONE Support '!' as a synonym for NOT
   CLOSED: [2010-11-12 Fri 20:46]
** TODO Proximity search
** TODO Term boosting
** TODO Fuzzy searches
** TODO Put code into a QP module
This may be a bit tricky b/c treetop is finding the extension modules
by name.
* Notes
** How to debug rules
You can get some good debug info by adding an executable look-ahead to
a rule.  Here's an example:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
   rule group
    space? '(' body ')' space? &{|s| puts "group: #{s.inspect}"; true } <Group>
   end
#+END_SRC

The block must return true, otherwise the rule won't succeed.
